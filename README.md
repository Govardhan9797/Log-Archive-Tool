# Log-Archive-Tool

Log Archiver â€” with Email Alerts and Remote Upload

ðŸ§  Overview:

This project is an advanced command-line log archiving tool designed for Unix-based systems (like Linux or macOS). It automatically compresses and archives log files from a specified directory into a .tar.gz file, keeps a local record of archive operations, and optionally emails the user an update or uploads the archive to a remote server or cloud storage.

Itâ€™s ideal for system administrators, DevOps engineers, or developers who want to:

Keep /var/log clean,

Store backups securely, and

Get notified about archive activity automatically.
